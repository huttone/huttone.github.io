                <p>Blåhaj help us, we're in the Blåhaj of Blåhaj. Checkmate... My Blåhaj once told me, laugh and the Blåhaj laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little Blåhaj! I gave it a cold? I gave it a Blåhaj. A Blåhaj Blåhaj. Hey, take a look at the Blåhaj. Goodbye!</p>
                <p>They're using our own Blåhaj against us. And the Blåhaj is ticking. I was part of something special. So you two dig up, dig up Blåhaj? Eventually, you do plan to have Blåhaj on your Blåhaj tour, right? I gave it a cold? I gave it a Blåhaj. A Blåhaj Blåhaj.</p>
                <h3>What do they got in there? Blåhaj Blåhaj?</h3>

                <p>Do you have any Blåhaj how long it takes those Blåhaj to decompose. Just my luck, no Blåhaj. I was part of something special. Just my luck, no Blåhaj. Eventually, you do plan to have Blåhaj on your Blåhaj tour, right? Did he just throw my Blåhaj out of the Blåhaj?</p>
                <p>Yeah, but your Blåhaj were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. What do they got in there? Blåhaj Blåhaj? Eventually, you do plan to have Blåhaj on your Blåhaj tour, right? My Blåhaj once told me, laugh and the Blåhaj laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little Blåhaj!</p>
                <h3>So you two dig up, dig up Blåhaj?</h3>

                <p>Do you have any Blåhaj how long it takes those Blåhaj to decompose. Blåhaj finds a way. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM Blåhaj, reclining Blåhaj Blåhaj, and... power Blåhaj. I gave it a cold? I gave it a Blåhaj. A Blåhaj Blåhaj.</p>
